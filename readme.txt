I run most methods on Google Colab, those files can be reached in Colab Notebook folder.

I also have some methods run on Kaggle, which ends in OnKaggle

The rest files are run locally on PC.

I saved every file in .py format in case you can't reach certain servers.

I tried CNN1d CNN2d ConvVAE LSTM GAN and DataAugmentationï¼Œ
which you can see by filenames.

Thanks!
